Course Tweaker is an automated course recommendation system designed to help users discover relevant courses based on their preferences and feedback. This system utilizes machine learning techniques, natural language processing (NLP), and interactive dashboards to provide personalized course suggestions. Using the "neattext" library which is used in Natural Language processing helps in removing stop words, and special characters, and also helps in stemming, lemmatization, and many more in NLP.

# Features
- Homepage & Dashboard: Users are greeted with an intuitive dashboard upon login, featuring interactive charts and elements powered by Chart.js.
- Course Recommendation Engine: Leveraging a dataset from Udemy, the recommendation engine employs custom algorithms such as Cosine Similarity and Linear Similarity to suggest courses tailored to each user's interests.
- Chatbot Integration: A machine learning-driven chatbot, integrated with Flask framework and various libraries, assists users in exploring course options and provides assistance based on natural language inputs. Training and testing are facilitated in Jupyter Notebook for efficient dataset refinement and model development.  
- Filtering and Feedback Loop: User preferences and feedback are continuously collected and processed to enhance the recommendation system's accuracy through a feedback loop mechanism.  
- Final Confirmation and Multiple Course References: Upon receiving course recommendations, users are presented with multiple options and detailed course information for informed decision-making.

# Workflow
1) Importing the dataset.
2) Performed Text Processing and EDA and generated insights, then converted text to numeric values.
3) After converting text to numeric values, will calculate the cosine similarity score.
4) Then will sort the values that will have similar similarity scores and recommend the course.
5) Integrate the Recommendation System with FLASKÂ Framework.

# Technological Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for user interface development.
- Backend: Flask for server-side development.  
- Machine Learning and NLP: Jupyter notebooks, scikit-learn, "neattext" library for data preprocessing and model training.
- Recommendation Engine: Custom algorithms utilizing Cosine Similarity, Linear Similarity for course recommendation.
- Chatbot: NLP-based chatbot integrated with Flask for natural language interactions.
- Dashboard: Chart.js for dynamic and visually appealing data visualization.
